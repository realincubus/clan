Project Status
--------------

This project aims to use clan together with clang.
This will make it possible to parse C++ code and make it easier
to extend clan. 
In particular i am using YouCompleteMe to generate an clang AST from the C++ Code 
i am editing. This AST is analyzed by clan-clang and definitions scop are generated.
The definitions are exchanged via osl and read by pluto.

The aim is to be able to make the best use of the information the compiler has at compile time 
and to generate error messages that tell the user why something can't be a scop.
This way the user might be able to fix the problem so that the optimization can work.


2015-07-21 16:42 a simple example that contains one loop and an if statement works
2015-07-24 14:08 i have a clang tool that calls the functions provided in clan-clang 
		 this tool can work as a replacement for clan and the tests for clan can be 
                 performed with this tool. 
                 right now it can run the gauss.c test 

Tasks
_____

- make a clan program replacement called clan-clang that has the same arguments as clan
  - run all the test cases that exist for clan with clan-clang
